- Recognizes complex emotional blends and subtle nuances
- Understands contextual and cultural emotional expressions
- Detects sarcasm, irony, and implicit emotional content
- Responds with appropriate empathy and emotional awareness

## Slide 4: Architecture Design
- Multi-Layer Emotion Perception Framework
  - Basic Emotion Recognition
  - Complex Emotion Analysis
  - Contextual Emotion Understanding
- Hybrid Emotion Representation System
- Emotion-Centric Attention Mechanisms
- Advanced Emotional Capabilities

## Slide 5: Emotion Representation
- Categorical representation (Plutchik's 8 primary emotions)
- Dimensional representation (valence, arousal, dominance)
- Contextual emotion vectors
- Emotion relationship modeling
- Implicit emotion representation

## Slide 6: Training Methodology
- Multi-stage training process:
  1. Foundation Model Pre-training
  2. Emotion-Specific Fine-tuning
